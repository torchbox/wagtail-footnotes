[![Build Status](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-footnotes/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-footnotes/actions)

Add footnotes functionality to your Wagtail project.

## ‚ö° Quick start

Add `wagtail_footnotes` to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "wagtail_footnotes",
    # ...
]
```

Add the footnotes `urls.py` to your project's `urls.py`:

```python
# urls.py
# ...
from wagtail_footnotes import urls as footnotes_urls


urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("footnotes/", include(footnotes_urls)),
    # ...
]
```

*Note*: The URL has to be defined as above as it is currently hardcoded in the JavaScript.

Update your page models to show the footnotes panel:

```python
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.admin.panels import InlinePanel


class InformationPage(Page):
    # ...
    content_panels = [
        # ...
        InlinePanel("footnotes", label="Footnotes"),
    ]
```

Make and run migrations:

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Showing footnotes in page templates

Update your page templates to include `{% include "wagtail_footnotes/includes/footnotes.html" %}`. You can copy from this template and instead include your own customized version.

### Using footnotes in `RichTextField`

Update any `RichTextField`s that you want to add footnotes feature.
Add `"footnotes"` to the `features` argument for each `RichTextField` that you want to have this functionality. For instance:

```python
class InformationPage(Page):
    body = RichTextField(
        features=[
            "h1",
            "h2",
            "h3",
            "h4",
            "footnotes",  # Make sure this line is part of the features
        ],
    )

```

[See Wagtail's documentation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/customisation/page_editing_interface.html#limiting-features-in-a-rich-text-field) for a list of features that you may want to configure since we are overwriting the defaults.

### Using footnotes in `StreamField`s

In order to have footnotes available in a `RichTextBlock`, you will need to change `RichTextBlock`s to `wagtail_footnotes.blocks.RichTextBlockWithFootnotes`. For instance:

```python
from wagtail_footnotes.blocks import RichTextBlockWithFootnotes
# ...

class MyPage(Page):
    body = StreamField(
        [
            # ...
            ("paragraph", RichTextBlockWithFootnotes()),  # Using RichTextBlockWithFootnotes
            # ...
        ],
    )
```

### Adding footnotes as a global default

You might want to simply have all RichText editors display footnotes. But remember that you will need the footnotes `InlinePanel` added
on all your Page models for the footnotes functionality to be enabled.

```python
# settings.py
# ...
WAGTAILADMIN_RICH_TEXT_EDITORS = {
    "default": {
        "WIDGET": "wagtail.admin.rich_text.DraftailRichTextArea",
        "OPTIONS": {"features": ["bold", "italic", "h3", "h4", "ol", "ul", "link", "footnotes"]},
    }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

- `WAGTAIL_FOOTNOTES_TEXT_FEATURES`
  - Default: `["bold", "italic", "link"]`
  - Use this to update a list of Rich Text features allowed in the footnote text.

## üåç Internationalisation

Wagtail Footnotes can be translated. Note that in a multi-lingual setup, the URL setup for footnotes
needs to be in a `i18n_patterns()` call with `prefix_default_language=False`:

```python
# urls.py

urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
    path("footnotes/", include(footnotes_urls)),
    # ...
    path("", include(wagtail_urls)),
    prefix_default_language=False,
)
```

or outside `i18n_patterns()`:

```python
# urls.py

urlpattherns += [
    path("footnotes/", include(footnotes_urls)),
]
urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
    # ...
    path("", include(wagtail_urls)),
)
```

## üí° Common issues

- I click on the `Fn` button in the editor and it stops working
  - This is likely because the URL in the JS does not match the URL of the footnotes view. Check the URL in `wagtail_footnotes/static/footnotes/js/footnotes.js` matches the URL you set.
- `NoneType` error when rendering page.
  - Make sure you are rendering the field in the template using `{% include_block page.field_name %}`
