# Wagtail Footnotes

Add footnotes functionality to your Wagtail project.

## Usage
 - Add the app to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       "wagtail_footnotes",
       ...
   ]
   ```
 - Add the footnotes `urls.py` to your project's `urls.py`:
   ```python
   from wagtail_footnotes import urls as footnotes_urls
   urlpatterns = [
       ...
       path("footnotes/", include(footnotes_urls)),
       ...
   ]
   ```
   Note: The URL has to be defined as above as it is currently hardcoded in the Javascript.
 - Update your page models to show the footnotes field:
   ```python
   class InformationPage(BasePage):
        ...
        content_panels = [
            ...
            InlinePanel("footnotes", label="Footnotes"),
        ]
   ```
 - Update your `RichTextBlock`s 
    - Add `"footnotes"` to the `features` arg for each `RichTextBlock` that you want to have this functionality
    - You will also need to change any `RichTextBlock`s to `wagtail_footnotes.blocks.RichTextBlockWithFootnotes`
 - Update your page templates to include `{% include "wagtail_footnotes/includes/footnotes.html" %}`
 - Make and run migrations:
   ```
   ./manage.py makemigrations
   ./manage.py migrate
   ```

## Settings

 - `WAGTAIL_FOOTNOTES_TEXT_FEATURES`
   - Default: `["bold", "italic", "link"]`
   - Use this to update a list of Rich Text features allowed in the footnote text.

## Common issues
 - I click on the `Fn` button in the editor and it stops working
    - This is likely because the URL in the JS does not match the URL of the footnotes view. Check the URL in `wagtail_footnotes/static/footnotes/js/footnotes.js` matches the URL you set.
 - `NoneType` error when rendering page.
    - Make sure you are rendering the field in the template using `{% include_block page.field_name %}`
